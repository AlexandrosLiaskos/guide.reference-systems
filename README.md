## 🎯 The Two Parts of Every Citation

Every academic paper uses citations in **two places**:

### 1. Inline Citation (In-Text)
A brief reference within your text that points to a source. Appears right where you use the information.

### 2. Bibliography (Reference List / Works Cited)
A complete list at the end of your paper with full details of every source you cited.

**Both parts are required.** The inline citation tells readers "this came from somewhere" and the bibliography tells them exactly where to find it.

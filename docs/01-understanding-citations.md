# Understanding Citations

## The Two Components

Every citation system has two parts that work together:

### 1. Inline Citation
- Appears **in your text** where you use information from a source
- Brief identifier that points to full details
- Format varies by style (author-date, numbered, footnote)

### 2. Bibliography Entry
- Appears **at the end** of your paper
- Contains complete source information
- Allows readers to find and verify your sources

## When You Must Cite

**Always cite when you:**
- Quote exact words from a source
- Paraphrase someone's ideas in your own words
- Summarize information from a source
- Use facts, statistics, or data
- Reference images, tables, or figures
- Build on someone's theory or argument

**You don't need to cite:**
- Common knowledge (widely known facts)
- Your own original ideas
- Your own research data
- Generally accepted facts
